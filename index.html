                    One of the main health benefits of Greek yogurt is its probiotic content. Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that live in the gut and help to keep the digestive system healthy. Greek yogurt is made by straining the liquid whey from regular yogurt, which results in a thicker, creamier product that is high in protein and lower in sugar. This process also concentrates the probiotics in the yogurt, making it a particularly good source of these beneficial bacteria. Consuming probiotics can help to improve digestion, boost the immune system, and reduce the risk of certain diseases.

            </section>
            <section>
                <p>
                    Greek yogurt is made by straining the liquid whey from regular yogurt, which results in a thicker, creamier product that is high in protein and lower in sugar. This process also removes most of the lactose, which is the sugar that is found in milk. This makes Greek yogurt a great option for people who are lactose intolerant because they are less likely to experience symptoms such as bloating and diarrhea.
